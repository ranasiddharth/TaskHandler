# TaskHandler
This app is a project management tool. These projects belong to various members of IMG. It uses Oauth2 to log-in the IMG members to the app where one can view the projects they are working on. Each project has fields which keep a track of various things such as its creator, the project members, project description, date of creation, completion status etc. It also gives special power to moderators to view others' projects, provide admin role to normal users, and make changes in projects. Each project has various lists, which contain cards and helps project members to work in an organized way. Upon login, the user is directed to dashboard where he can see all his projects, and the cards which are assigned to them. This also has a chat feature which is available to every person in order to discuss an ongoing project.
